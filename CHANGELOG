Version 3.1.0
----------------
There is no 3.0.
Added 2008.11.30
	- Changed version # convention in the format Major.Minor.Subminor
	-- If the minor version is an odd number this means it is an unstable
		release. The release may need some testing and may possibly
		have some bugs (or missing code in the event I rushed a release... hehe)
	-- Updated Copyright date in the about dialog
	-- changed the top margin of about dialog to 0

Unknown Date Added
	-- Added TABS! Equipment macro files can now be opened in multiple tabs, to
		make editing easier.
		Codewise this switched the GUI interface to use a custom widget
	-- Removed the "Write File" button (due to some technicalities in coding as
		well as the obvious redundancy).
	-- Changed format in Recent menu to show the parent directory for the
		files as well. i.e. "rdm/tp.txt" instead of "tp.txt"
Version 2.0
----------------
Added 2007.12.16
	- Changed the interface.
	--	Removed tabs
	--	Added the "extra data bin"
	--	Added some GUI components for easy extra data
		manipulation.
	--	Made separate dialog for about screen
	--	Added toobar
	--	Added view menu (to switch views)
	--	Added help menu (for about and project page options)
	- Changed updateTitle() function, no string needs to be specified
	  now. Call only the updateTitle(void) function.
	- updated version # in comments and added contact e-mail.
	- updated dates in change log (years were all set 2006, but this
	  was a typo for 2007)
	- fixed possible bug that would add an infinite number of
	  "//Extra data found in file:" lines from extra data detection.
	- added new test suite case with an extra command, which was generated
	  by Equipmant,
	- added program icon for windows


Version 1.2.3
----------------
Added 2007.08.04
	- Added the extra data feature. This feature will (hopefully) prevent
	  Equipmant from throwing out any extra data you might have in your
	  file. (i.e., Extra added Job Abilities and Spells, etc.) also any
	  comments that you add to the file will get tossed down to the bottom
	  of your output file (in the extra data segment).
	- Switched the output comments to use preprocessor macros instead of
	  typing them out directly (to make any possible changes in the future
	  quicker). These macros (EQM_OPC1 and EQM_OPC2 are stored in the
	  imp_equipmant.h file).
	- Updated the output comment line 2 (EQM_OPC2) to display the new
	  sourceforge URL also.
	- Updated hyperlink in the About UI to point to the sourceforge page.
	- Added 2 new test cases for the Extra Data feature, 5.equip and 6.equip
	  descriptions should be inside the files in the form of comments
	  describing their purpose. Load them with Equipmant and view output to
	  see how they work, then compare this output to the original file
	  contents.

Version 1.2.2
----------------
Added 2007.06.30
	- Fixed a bug in the recent file menus. When selecting the first recent
	  item, another instance of that item was added to the menu.


Version 1.2.1
----------------
Added 2007.06.30
	- Fixed a bug in the recent files menu that caused all recent files to show
	  even when there were no recent files.
	- Fixed a bug in the loadData() routine that caused path names containing
	  spaces to read in as recent files.


Version 1.2
----------------
Added 2007.06.29
	- Implemented the use of the EQM_VERSION macro in the about screen; the GUI
	  no longer has to be updated with the version number.
	- Added dash line separators in CHANGELOG under each version number (for
	  better readability).
	- Added Last File Directory memory. Equipmant save/open dialogs will now
	  be directed to the path of the last file you opened or saved. (This
	  change was not necessary for the Mac OS X file dialogs, however the
	  Windows common dialog had its issues)newline at end of source files (to
	  remove compiler warnings).
	- Removed comment block in writeFile(QString) routine containing old,
	  unused (temporary) code.
	- Added status bar messages for the following actions:
		- File/New
		- File/Open
		- File/Close
	- Added recent documents list option (File->Open Recent)
	- Added newline at end of source files (to remove compiler warnings)
	- "View Output" text field is now updated on file load. (previously this
	  text field went blank if a file was opened while in "View Output" tab.

Version 1.1.3
----------------
	- Added hyperlink to the official URL in the about dialog.
	- Updated version # in comment blocks (-_-;)
	- Created program Icon
	- Added program icon to about screen
	- Implemented Desktop icon on OS X version.
Added 2007.06.28:
	** Decided to add dates to CHANGELOG info **
	- Added current file name to title bar.
	- Added default file extension .equip
	- Updated version information on file output (-_-;)
	- Main window title now displays the version number.

Version 1.1.2
----------------
	- Reduced font sizes of certain text in the About tab (it was way too big
	  under windows, so it has been set to 10pt font, for Windows and Mac).
	- Added a minimum height to the form (this allowed the height to be set to
	  319, which packed the widgets closer together vertically).
	- Removed horizontal scrollbar from About tab's TextBrowser widget and
	  fixed the line wrapping on it. The lines are now properly wrapped.
	- Added more details about the license in the About tab TextBrowser.
	- Removed the equipmant12.ui file (since it was not being used and only
	  caused confusion when running the qmake -project command. Additionally,
	  this UI wasn't being used, and will probably be modified more later on
	  before it is implemented).
	- Changed archive naming convention to add -src after to show that the
	  archive contains source code. (this might help!)

Version 1.1.1
----------------
	- Fixed file format of some documents (now the files are terminated with the
	  standard DOS CR/LF terminations).
	- Added some more detail to instructions.txt on what to do after your files
	  are generated

Version 1.1
----------------
	- Changed parse method (old method had possible room for bugs) and moved it
	  to another function.
	- Changed label L.ear and R.ear to L.Ear and R.Ear (case change)
	- Fixed "Gemerated" typo in output comment
	- Added Docs folder and short instructions
	- Added GPL to the About dialog
	- Added GPL header to all source files (WHOOPS!)
